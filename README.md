# Parallax Website📌  

Parallax is the observed displacement of an object caused by the change of the observer's point of view.

Through this website you will experience a smooth parallax effect featuring a landscape with hot air balloons. As you scroll, you'll see layers of hills, forests, and sky move at different speeds, creating a subtle 3D effect. The hot air balloons add a gentle touch of motion to the scene.
